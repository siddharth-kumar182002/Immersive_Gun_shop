# Three.js Interactive Scene with Pointer Lock Controls

This project demonstrates an interactive 3D scene built with Three.js, featuring pointer lock controls, raycasting, and dynamic content loading. The scene includes various 3D models (e.g., guns) that can be selected to display information in a modal dialog.

## Features

- **Three.js**: A lightweight, cross-browser JavaScript library for creating and displaying animated 3D graphics.
- **Pointer Lock Controls**: Provides immersive first-person controls.
- **Raycasting**: Used to detect and interact with 3D objects.
- **Dynamic Content Loading**: Loads 3D models dynamically and displays loading progress.
- **Bootstrap Modal**: Displays information about selected objects in a modal dialog.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (for setting up a local development environment)
- [Three.js](https://threejs.org/)
- [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

3. **Run the development server:**

    ```bash
    npx vite
    ```

    This will start a local server and open the project in your default web browser. The server will automatically reload as you make changes to the code.


## Usage

1. **Controls:**

    - **Move:** Use `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` keys to move forward, left, backward, and right.
    - **Look:** Move the mouse to look around.
    - **Select Objects:** Click on objects (e.g., guns) to view more information in a modal dialog.

## Project Structure

- `index.html`: The main HTML file.
- `main.css`: Custom styles.
- `script.js`: The main JavaScript file that initializes the scene and handles interactions.
- `assets/`: Directory containing 3D models and textures.
